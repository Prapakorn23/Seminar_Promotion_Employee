## ðŸ“Œ HR Analytics â€“ Employee Promotion Prediction
**Goal:**  
Build a machine learning model to **predict employee promotions** using HR analytics data (48,000+ rows).  

### ðŸ”‘ Key Features:
- Preprocessed and analyzed HR data using **Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn)**.
- Built and tuned ML models: **SVM, Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost**.
- Applied **SMOTE** to address class imbalance and **Feature Selection** to improve performance.
- Evaluated models using **Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score**.

### ðŸ“Š Results:
- Increased model accuracy from **72% â†’ 85%** with improved F1-score.
- Developed an end-to-end pipeline from data cleaning to model evaluation.
